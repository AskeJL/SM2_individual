We are working with a greenhouse project as well, specifically rows of certain specicies of plants with specific needs.
Each row is only for a single species of plants. E.g. a row for tomatoes and a row for cucumbers.
Both the greenhouse itself and each row individually can have a variety of sensors and actuators associated with it.
E.g. the greenhouse can have a temperature sensor and a collection of window openers as actuators.
The sensors are responsible for sending their value to a specified topic - this does not really require special logic, so
we dont think it is really necessary to use the DSL to generate this logic. The same goes for the actuators, they are only
responsible for receiving commands on mqtt topics and execute the commands (like open a window).
Instead, the DSL should be responsible for generating the controller. 
The controller is responsible for handling the state of
